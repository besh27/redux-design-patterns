# Principles of Redux

## 1st Principle
- The entire app's state is contained in a single object. 

## 2nd Principle
- The state tree object is read only. 
- The tree cannot be mutated directly. 
- Any changes need to be made via a dispatched action. 
- And action is a plain object describing the action/change to the state.
