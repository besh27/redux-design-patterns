## Why?

I simply wanted a place to store my notes about redux design patters and best practices. I'm currently refactoring some of my personal projects and having all my redux related notes in one place may be a good idea. Keep in mind, these are living docs and are a work in progress. 

If you find these helpful, please keep reading. Also, if you'd like to contribute, send me a PR!
